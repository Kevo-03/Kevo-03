## Human Instance - Currently Undergoing Debugging

Welcome to my profile. I'm a human instance currently navigating a critical, multi-vector regression. My core functionality has been a bit unstable lately, but I'm actively applying patches. This README serves as an ongoing bug report and a cry for help.

---

### About Me (Current Known Issues)

-   🧠 **`Stuck Processing Loop:`** My primary conversation module has entered an infinite loop. All conversational inputs, regardless of content, are being rerouted to a single, hard-coded topic: `BALDURS_GATE_3`. This is a showstopper bug I'm working to resolve.

-   🔋 **`Persistent HealthManager Failure:`** I've been stuck in `LOW_POWER_MODE` (colloquially "Sick Mode") for an extended duration, resulting in high `cough.sfx` output and a general reduction in my energy resource pool. Standard `reboot_sleep` cycles are in progress.

-   💸 **`Resource Allocation Error:`** A severe misconfiguration in my `DesireEngine` has set the weighting for `luxury_items` to `INT_MAX`. This "Luxury Crazy" state is non-sustainable, but I'm actively editing the config file.

-   💅 **`Undocumented SocialProtocol Override:`** An undocumented behavioral script, `rainbow_config.ini`, has been loaded, resulting in a significant increase in "fabulous" gestures and a higher-than-normal "yassification" process load. It's not a bug, it's a feature... I think.

-   💔 **`Catastrophic Rizz.exe Failure:`** A long-standing, well-documented issue. All attempts to initialize the `FemaleInteractionSubsystem` fail with `Error 404: Rizz Not Found`. This module may be deprecated pending a full rewrite from scratch.
